# Write a program which, given a dictionary, generates two output files, 'sequences'
# and 'words'. 'sequences' should contain every sequence of four letters that appears
# in exactly one word of the dictionary, one sequence per line. 'words' should contain
# the corresponding words that contain the sequences, in the same order, again one
# per line.
